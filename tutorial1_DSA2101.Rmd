## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data,inclue=FALSE}
library(stringr)
load("../data/tut01_ay2021_s2.rdt")
```
##Question 1
```{r replacing-strings}
road_names<-den_df[,3]
qn1_char<-str_replace_all(road_names, c("Pl[^a-z]" = "Place", "Ter[^a-z]" = "Terrace", "Lk[^a-z]" = "Link", "Cl[^a-z]" = "Close", "Gr[^a-z]" = "Grove"))
```

## Question 2
```{r extract-hdb-block-numbers}
block_num<-str_extract(den_df$description, "(?<=Blk )[0-9, ]+")
qn2_list<-strsplit(block_num, ", ")
qn2_list
```

##Question 3
Extract all condominium names (names in parenthesis without “Blk”). Store these in a list of length 60
named qn3_list. 
```{r extract-condominium-names}
#we dont want to include strings that start with  blk also
condo_names1<-str_extract_all(den_df$description,"(?<=\\()[^Blk][^)]+")
#unlist our condo_names1 and split it
qn3_list<-sapply(condo_names1, function(x) as.character(unlist(str_split(x, ", "))))
qn3_list
```


##Question 4
filter those with more than 10 cases
```{r filter-for-more-than-10-cases}
qn4_list<-qn3_list[den_df$num.cases>=10]
qn4_list
```

##Question 5
Return only those rows of den_df where there were 2 or more condominiums listed. Store this data frame in qn5_df
We have to look at the length of the rows

```{r 2-or-more-condominiums}
qn5_df<-den_df[sapply(qn3_list,length)>=2,]
qn5_df
```



#Section 2

##Question 6
Convert the distances to units of kilometres. Store your output in hawker_dist2.
Divide the values by 1000.
```{r distance-to-km}
hawker_dist2 <- hawker_dist/1e3
```


##Question 7
```{r find-nearest}
two_step <- function(h_name,h_dists) {
  valid_names<-rownames(h_dists)
  if(!h_name %in% valid_names) {
    stop()
  }
  #hawker_dist2[hawker_dist2==0]<-NA doesnt work
  diag(h_dists)<-NA
  check<-which(rownames(h_dists)==h_name)
  index<-which.min(h_dists[h_name,])
  step1<-names(index)
  index2<-which.min(h_dists[step1, -check])
  step2<-names(index2)
  step2
}
two_step("Alexandra Village Food Centre", hawker_dist2)

```
